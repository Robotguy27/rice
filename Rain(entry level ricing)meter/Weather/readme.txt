1. Copy all the files to your Rainmeter folder which is inside your Documents folder.
2. Look up your location at www.weather.com and change "location=..." to your location using the right click menu and "Edit skin...".
3. Right Click the skin, click on 'Edit skin...' if you want Fahrenheit measures, change "type=m" to "type=f" and "postfix=C" to "postfix=F".


Thanks for using my extreme simple weather skin :)
