<h2>AHK - </h2>

All scripts that I use, change the locations in Scrot, and my tiling is setup for two monitors so obviously only some hotkeys would work with one, ~make sure numlock is turned off~.

<h2>BBLEAN - </h2>

Plugins that I've edited for bbLean, styles that I've made for it.

<h2>FB2 - </h2>

Includes all components that you'd need for the skins in the zip, if it doesn't work install the ncmp mod and follow the [faq](http://pastebin.com/QbGNnzsZ) for that, if you're already familar with fb (and installed the mod) you won't have any problems.

<h2>MISC RICE - </h2>

As the title says, programs that make ricing a lot easier.

<h2>RAINMETER - </h2>

Skins that I use, either made from scratch or super super edited from someone else.

For System Info download [Core Temp](http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/Core-Temp-installer.exe) and [MSI Afterburner](http://download.msi.com/uti_exe/vga/MSIAfterburnerSetup400.zip) and place shortcuts for them in your startup folder (C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)

<h2>STARTPAGES - </h2>

Contains two old startpages I've used.

<h2>VS - </h2>

Read [this](http://neiio.deviantart.com/art/How-to-Install-Custom-Themes-262833454) if you've never installed a VS, make sure to patch your windows before complaining in desktop threads about a VS not working.

All versions of Nocturnal are included, including ones not on DA because there not a big enough change to put on there, also contains Mokocchi (if for some reason you want that god awful VS) and Siren.




I upload my CSS [here](https://userstyles.org/users/268662) now and update them pretty frequently so I won't bother keeping them at git/gist.
VS's and other things are uploaded [here](http://decagonal.deviantart.com/)~
