<h2>Rice!~</h2>

AHK - 

All scripts that I use, change the locations in Scrot, and my tiling is setup for two monitors so obviously only some hotkeys would work with one, ~make sure numlock is turned off~.

BBLEAN - 

Plugins that I've edited for bbLean, styles that I've made for it.

FB2 - 

Includes all components that you'd need for the skins, if it doesn't work install the ncmp mod and follow the <a href="http://pastebin.com/QbGNnzsZ">faq</a> for that, if you're already familar with fb (and installed the mod) you won't have any problems.

MISC RICE - 

As the title says, programs that make ricing a lot easier.

RAINMETER - 

Skins that I use, either made from scratch or super super edited from someone else.

For System Info download <a href="http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/Core-Temp-installer.exe">Core Temp</a> and <a href="http://download.msi.com/uti_exe/vga/MSIAfterburnerSetup400.zip">MSI Afterburner</a> and place shortcuts for them in your startup folder (C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)

STARTPAGES - 

Contains two old startpages I've used.

VS - 

Read <a href="http://neiio.deviantart.com/art/How-to-Install-Custom-Themes-262833454">this</a> if you've never installed a VS, make sure to patch your windows before complaining in desktop threads about a VS not working.

All versions of Nocturnal are included, including ones not on DA because there not a big enough change to put on there, also contains Mokocchi (if for some reason you want that god awful VS) and Siren.


I upload my CSS <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/268662">here</a> now and update them pretty frequently so I won't bother keeping them at git/gist.
VS's and other things are uploaded <a href="http://decagonal.deviantart.com/">here</a>~
